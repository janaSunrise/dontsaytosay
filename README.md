# Don't say to say

Don't say to say, just say what you want to say.

I've built this for making people to get straight to the point, and for:
- Beating around the bush for a single topic
- Being vague about the topic
- Just saying statements like "can you help?" or "can you do xyz?" and waiting for a follow-up.
- Request for frequent calls for micro-topics
- Talking about something else and get this to later on.
